## Jonathan, aka Vorlias
Hi there! I'm Jonathan, known on the internet by my internet moniker - Vorlias.

- I am a full time software engineer for [Easy Games](https://easy.gg), working primarily on [Airship](https://airship.gg).
- I was a developer on Roblox from 2008 to 2023, and also worked on a game called Islands for Easy Games during my time as a Roblox developer. I am also an original contributor to [roblox-ts](//roblox-ts.com), which eventually lead to me working on the Airship compiler [unity-ts](https://github.com/easy-games/unity-ts) based on it.
